# RsqMed (updated Sep 22, 2019)
R package designed for calculating the Rsq measure for high-dimensional mediation analysis. 
* works under on linux R, R version > 3.5.0

Required R package:
* GMMAT: GMMAT can be found at https://github.com/hanchenphd/GMMAT. The current used version is 1.1. Details of the installation steps are provided in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GMMAT/vignettes/GMMAT.pdf.
* SIS: more in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIS/SIS.pdf


# How to install RsqMed
* Step 1: download the 'RsqMed_0.1.1.tar.gz' file into the local folder.
* Step 2: open R, and set the directory to this local folder 
 ```r
 setwd('local folder')
 ```
 
* Step 3: install the two required R packages, GMMAT and SIS. 
 ```r
 #install SIS
install.packages('SIS')

#install GMMAT
install.packages('devtools')
install_github('hanchenphd/GMMAT')
 ```
* Step 4: install the package in R
```r
install.packages('RsqMed_0.1.1.tar.gz',repos=NULL,type='source')
```

# Example  
## Impute data
The data "example" is a simulated sample with 100 observations, which can be accessed by the following code.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(RsqMed)
str(example)
```
The example is saved with the package. X can be regarded as independent variable, Y is the outcome variable, Cov is the covariate matrix, M is the putative mediator matrix.
$$Y_i = 2X + M\beta + Cov\beta_{cov} + r_2$$
$r_1$ and $r_2$ are the residuals, $\alpha_i$ is the element of alpha, $\beta$ is the beta vector, $\beta_{cov}$ is the Cov.beta.

### Calculating point estimates 
```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=F}
Rsq.measure(p=1/2, outcome=example$Y,med=example$M,covar=example$Cov,indp=example$X, method='iSIS',iter.max=1, screening=F,init.cutoff=0.1)$output
```
Use ?Rsq.measure to read more about the input and output of the Rsq.measure function. We added a prescreening step in this function, which is not presented in the paper. It may decrease computation burden in some cases and we suggest using a generous cut-off point.

### Calculate the confidence intervals using bootstrap
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=F}
CI.Rsq.measure(p=1/2, outcome=example$Y[1:50],med=example$M[1:50,1:10],covar=example$Cov[1:50,],indp=example$X[1:50], method='ALL', B=2)$CI
```
Use ?CI.Rsq.measure to read more about the input and output of the CI.Rsq.measure function.
